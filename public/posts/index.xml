      <description>Crate-training a puppy can be tough and a total surprise when you come home to find that they’ve torn up their bed, had an accident, or worse, broken free and vandalized your apartment. My dog, Harper, has done all three, but has since learned to love her cozy den. As I teased in my “Hello World” post, I built a dog monitor using a Raspberry Pi to see what she was up to while I was gone.</description>
